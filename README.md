### Why I chose Pune?
1. Staying here since 3 years, hence would be easier to spot trivial errors
2. Though this would not be the case always, it's better to familiarize with known set of data

### What all things will be done?
1. Cleaning data
2. Making data available into a Database. I have mysql which is a Relational database
3. Querying the database to get insights

### What all Softwares/Technologies did I use?
- mysql
- python
